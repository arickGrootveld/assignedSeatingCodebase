# Assigned Seating Script

This script exists to solve a problem that we (Ziyang Liu, Professor Zafarani, and myself (Arick Grootveld)) realized while teaching CIS 321 for Spring 2022. 

The problem is the following: with over 90 students in the class, and with only 3 people to proctor all these students, we wanted to come up with a way to assign students seats in an arbitrary classroom (described by a JSON file) such that we could accomodate students with disabilities (left handed, wheelchair access, etc.), while also maximizing distance between students, and randomizing their location in the class. 

This script was designed to meet these goals.
